Exclude from Project
==========================

At one point I had a bunch of really good project management commands in my
sidebar, and for the life of me I can't figure out (a) where they went (b) where
they came from and therefore (c) how to get them back, other than writing them
myself.

The most important was "hide from sidebar (and this project)", which I could use
to hide `dist/` or `node_modules/` or `build/` or `__pycache__` or whatever. I
didn't figure out how to exactly reproduce it (it didn't require a project file
to exist) but I'm almost always using a project anyway, so this'll do.

Right click in the sidebar - if you're in a project, you have the option to
exclude that file/folder from the project.
